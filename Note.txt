Here is a simple calculator code created using Go-Lang. This calculator has several features including:

1. Calculation of flat shapes
2. Angle calculations
3. Calculation of Uniformly Accelerated Linear Motion (GLB) and Uniformly Accelerated Rotational Motion (GLBB)
4. Calculation of potential and kinetic energy
5. Calculation of frequency and vibration
6. Calculation of density
7. Calculation of power, pressure, work, and force
8. Conversion of temperature units.
